strinf manipulation
mutable immutable

zero index notation

tuple = parentheses = immutable = unchangeable

list = square brackets = mutable = changeable

join is a method function 
we know that because of the dot .
':'.join(lettters) =j:e:l:l:o

split is a method function {splits by defaukt on spaces}
word.split('e') == jllo

num = int(input('type number here:/n'))
if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
  print('fizzbuzz')
elif num % 3 == 0:
  print('fizz')
elif num % 5 == 0:
  print('buzz')
else 
  print(num)

this is fizzbuzz test. uhhhhhhhhhhhh 
make it print 3 when divisible by three and make it buzz when divisble by 5 and make it fizzbuzz when divisible by by both

xmen + ['superman','night crawler','deadpool','storm']

for hero in xmen:
  if hero == 'superman':
    print('wrong universe')
  elif hero == 'deadpool':
    print(hero + 'is the best one!')
  else:
    print('this is a marvel hero')
this is an example of a for loop.
